## Customization

Most text and SEO fields are configurable through the siteMetadata object in [gatsby-config.js](./gatsby-config.js).

Project entries are located in `content/projects`, and writing entries in `content/writings`.

The About page text can be changed via shadowing, like [here](./src/gatsby-theme-dotdev/texts/bio.mdx). The picture in the About page is set [here](./content/assets/avatar.png).

For more advanced customizations, I recommend you fork [Gatsby Theme DotDev](https://github.com/KennethWangDotDev/gatsby-theme-dotdev).
